# WinYourDesktop
## A Desktop File Interpreter

You know what I don't like on Windows?

Link (.lnk) files.

You know what I loved when I stayed on Linux Mint?

Desktop (.desktop) files.

And I'm bringing, or will try to bring, an implementation for Windows.

# How do I use it?

## Via CLI

C:\\>WinYourDesktop test.desktop

## Via GUI

Comming at some point!

## Open automatically

To make WinYourDesktop open desktop file, go in the properties of a desktop file (via right click), then make WinYourDesktop open desktop files by default.

tl;dr: Right click desktop file, Properties, Make default.

# Notes

- Straightforward and simple thing for now.
- Firstly I'll complete the interpreter, making sure Batch scripting capabilities are covered.
  - Then do a nice little UI to either edit, view, or debug desktop files (if certain flags are specified).
- A __Release__ will be made once the interpreter will be _at least_ working.

I'm looking forward to finish it!
