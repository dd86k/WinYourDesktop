# WinYourDesktop
## A Desktop File Interpreter

You know what I don't like on Windows?

Shortcut (.lnk) files.

- Absolute path: Required
- Can use the CLI: No

You know what I loved when I stayed on Linux Mint?

Desktop (.desktop) files.

- Absolute path: Optional
- Can use the CLI: Yes

And I'm bringing, or will try to bring, an implementation (interpreter) for Windows.

# Notes

- Straightforward and simple thing for now.
- Firstly I'll complete the interpreter, making sure Batch scripting capabilities are covered.
  - Then do a nice little UI to either edit, view, or debug desktop files (if certain flags are specified).

I'm looking forward to finish it!
