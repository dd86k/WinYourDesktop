# WinYourDesktop
## A Desktop Entry file interpreter

You know what I don't like on Windows?

Shortcut (.lnk) files.

- Absolute path: Required
- Can use the CLI: No

You know what I loved when I stayed on Linux Mint?

Desktop Entry (.desktop) files.

- Absolute path: Optional
- Can use the CLI: Yes

And I'm bringing, or will try to bring, an implementation (at least an interpreter) for Windows.

# Installing

Simply put the executable file somewhere on your computer that you will remember.

Then make WinYourDesktop the default application to open Desktop Entry files.

# Installing (source)

You will need at least Visual Studio 2015 or a really recent version of Xamarin Studio or MonoDevelop (with some tweaks).

Please note that I'm writing C# 6.0 on .NET 4.0.

# Notes

- Straightforward and simple thing for now.
- Firstly I'll complete the interpreter, making sure Batch scripting capabilities are covered.
  - Then do a nice little UI to either edit, view, or debug desktop files (if certain flags are specified).

# FAQ

- Nothing here yet.

I'm looking forward to finish it!
